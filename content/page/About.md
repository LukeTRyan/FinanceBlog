Hey! My name's Luke. I'm a 26 year old Tech Manager, with experience in data, financial and systems analysis. I was born and raised in Brisbane, Australia, and grew up with an interest in IT and Finance. I studied Bachelor Degrees in Computer Science and Business, and went on to do a Masters Degree in Applied Finance. Now, I'm working on building my career, my experiences, my wealth and my happiness. This blog is focused on building financial foundations in Australia, by providing knowledge on investing, budgeting, superannuation, taxation and other personal finance intricacies. This space will be a collection on my notes and experiences in finance over the past decade, ranging from beginner lessons into budgeting and superannuation, into advanced discussions on Modern Portfolio Theory, financial data analysis and useful API integrations.
