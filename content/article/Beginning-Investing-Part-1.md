This is the first of a multi-part post dedicated to diving into the fundamentals of stock investing. The aim of this series is to be educational, informative and relevant in contemporary Australia, while not over-complicating the topic. In other words, this post is designed with a focus on passive investing for average Australians wishing to maximise their investment value and minimise their time resources expended. The series will be divided into 4 parts:
1. Asset allocation and Diversification
2. Investment value and timing
3. Infrastructure -  Brokers, Fees, Share Registry and Tracking
4. Tax Implications
