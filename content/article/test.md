Hey! I'm Luke, a mid 20's IT and Finance professional. You can read a bit more about my and why I'm writing this blog in the 'About' section in the navbar.

This blog is a collection of thoughts, concepts and best practices in the world of Australian personal finance. They come from personal experience and knowledge from studying finance, working, paying taxes, saving, budgeting, investing and living life to maximise wealth and happiness. These posts are a key to accountability in my own personal finance life, and a guide for others wanting to take an active approach to their own financial futures.
